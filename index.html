        <h1 id="section1" class="ptitle">Introduction</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">With this project we want to show you what will happen with the robotics in the future, what happend in the past and what is happening now. </p>
        
        <h1 id="section2" class="ptitle">What exactly is "Robotics"?</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Robotics is the engineering branch that deals with the conception, design, construction, operation, application, and usage of robots. Digging a little deeper, we see that robots are defined as an automatically operated machine that carries out a series of actions independently and does the work usually accomplished by a human.</p>

            <h1 id="section3" class="ptitle">The Past of Robotics</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">  Although the first industrial robots were created in the United States, in the 1980s and 1990s they were already being developed in some European and Asian countries, mainly in Japan and Sweden. You probably remember IBM’s Deep Blue beating world champion Garry Kasparov in a game of chess.  

            <h1 id="section4" class="ptitle">The Present of Robotics</h1>
            <p class="paragraph"> Nowadays, the development of Artificial Intelligence or other technologies such as those mentioned at the beginning of the article are so powerful that the game against Kasparov sounds obsolete. The applications that AI brings to robotics, and thus to the industrial sector, are infinitely more valuable and more profitable than winning chess games. Some of the advantages that AI brings to industrial robotics are: 

Increased accuracy 
Improved decision making (especially in the face of obstacles).
Predictive maintenance.

        <h1 id="section3" class="ptitle">The Future of Robotics</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence (AI) increases human-robot interaction, collaboration opportunities, and quality. The industrial sector already has co-bots, which are robots that work alongside humans to perform testing and assembly.

Advances in AI help robots mimic human behavior more closely, which is why they were created in the first place. Robots that act and think more like people can integrate better into the workforce and bring a level of efficiency unmatched by human employees.</p>
