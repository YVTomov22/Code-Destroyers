## Description
Our site will be used to informate people about robotics in the past, present and future.
It can be used to change people's mind about technology and robots and to help those who are interested in it.
I think that for our first year learning how to make websites we did a good job in informating people about the theme.

## Flaws about the website
I think we could have done better in the design but that's for later when we will have to do more websites.
Also communication wasn't the best mainly because we spoke to eachother rather by texting.
I think we could do better in the future when we are way more experienced in this theme.
