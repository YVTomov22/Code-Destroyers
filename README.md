## Past Robotics
In the past, robotics was primarily focused on industrial applications. Early robots were large and primarily designed for repetitive tasks in manufacturing environments. Some notable milestones include:

- 1954: George Devol invents the first digitally operated and programmable robotic arm, known as the Unimate.
- 1961: The first industrial robot, the Unimate, is installed in a General Motors factory.
- 1973: The development of the Stanford Arm marks a significant breakthrough in robotic manipulation capabilities.

## Present Robotics
Today, robotics has expanded into various domains, including healthcare, agriculture, space exploration, and even personal robotics. Modern robots feature advancements such as:

- AI and Machine Learning: Robots can now learn and adapt through advanced algorithms and deep neural networks.
- Human-Robot Interaction: Collaborative robots (cobots) work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety.
- Sensing and Perception: Robots utilize advanced sensors like lidar, cameras, and tactile sensors to understand their environment.

## Future Robotics
The future of robotics is expected to bring even more exciting advancements and possibilities. Here are some potential areas of growth:

- Swarm Robotics: Coordinated groups of robots working together to achieve complex tasks.
- Soft Robotics: Robots made of flexible and adaptive materials, enabling safe interaction with humans.
- Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars and drones will become more prevalent, revolutionizing transportation.
- Social Robotics: Robots designed to engage and assist humans in various social contexts.
